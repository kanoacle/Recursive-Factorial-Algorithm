# Recursive Factorial Algorithm

### Purpose
I am going to implement an algorithm to find the factorial of a given number. A factorial is defined as follows:

The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.

Ex. factorial(4) //4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

To see my implementation, look in the "js" folder above this ReadMe. If you'd like to look at my test files, look in the "tests" folder. To see how I actually tested the algorithms, and run the tests in real time, fork and clone this repository to your local computer with your terminal, then navigate into the directory created for this repository.

To install the dependencies neccessary and execute the tests, run the following commands...
1. `npm init --yes`
2. `npm i -D mocha chai`
3. `npm test`
